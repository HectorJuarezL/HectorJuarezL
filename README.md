 A little about me...  

```javascript
const Hector = {
  pronouns: 'He' | 'His',
  code: ['Python', 'Javascript', 'Java', 'C', 'C++', 'C#', 'SQL' , Go, Matlab, PHP, 'HTML', 'CSS' , 'Julia', 'R'], 
  tools: ['Tensorflow','Pytorch', 'Node', 'React', 'Flask', Django,  'Mongo', 'GCP', 'Snowflake'],
  areas: ['Artificial Intelligence', 'Machine Learning', 'Intertef of Things', 'Cloud', 'Data'],
}
```

âš¡ Fun fact: I started programming when I was 12 years old without realizing what I was doing, I used to program triggers for Warcraft III maps, later, when I was stutying computation at high school I realized I already knew programming, flow control, variables, etc.
